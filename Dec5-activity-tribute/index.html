              Lee gained a measure of celebrity with his role in the television
              series The Green Hornet, which aired in 26 episodes from 1966 to
              '67. In the show, which was based on a 1930s radio program, the
              wiry Lee displayed his acrobatic and theatrical fighting style as
              the Hornet's sidekick, Kato. He went on to make guest appearances
              in such TV shows as Ironside and Longstreet, while a notable film
              role came in 1969's Marlowe, starring James Garner as the notable
              detective created by Raymond Chandler. (The screenwriter for the
              film, Stirling Silliphant, was one of Lee's martial arts students.
              Other Lee students included James Coburn, Steve McQueen and Garner
              himself.)

            <p>
              While best known as a martial artist, Lee also studied drama and
              Asian and Western philosophy starting while a student at the
              University of Washington. He was well-read and had an extensive
              library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical
              texts. His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are
              known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside
              of martial arts circles. His eclectic philosophy often mirrored
              his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his
              martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He
              believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and
              said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts.
              His influences include Taoism, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and Buddhism.
              Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative
              worldview advocated by Confucianism. John Little states that Lee
              was an atheist. When asked in 1972 about his religious
              affiliation, he replied, "none whatsoever", and when asked if he
              believed in God, he said, "To be perfectly frank, I really do
              not."

            <p>
              On July 20, 1973, just one month before the premiere of Enter the
              Dragon, Lee died in Hong Kong, China, at the age of 32. The
              official cause of his sudden and utterly unexpected death was a
              brain edema, found in an autopsy to have been caused by a strange
              reaction to a prescription painkiller he was reportedly taking for
              a back injury. Controversy surrounded Lee's death from the
              beginning, as some claimed he had been murdered. There was also
              the belief that he might have been cursed, a conclusion driven by
              Lee's obsession with his own early death.
